//Using the rules of precedence and the console, rework the expression 5 + 5 * 10 /2 so that it resolves to 50. 
(5 + 5) * 10 / 2;

//Next, utilizing the variables defined below, write an expression that resolves to true using the double equals == operator.
var a = 15;
var b = 10;
var c = 30;
var d = 5;
a + b + d == c;
c - a == b + d;

//Using variables, write a simple program that 1) sends an alert to the user telling them to open the developer console in their browser and 2) logs a message to the console saying they have won a prize. Note: This is an imaginary practice scenario. In reality, you would want to avoid using console.log() to send messages to users when actually deploying your website. Any information you want the user of your webpage to see should be presented on the webpage itself.
alert("Please open the console log");
console.log("You have won a prize!");
